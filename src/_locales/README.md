# Notes for translators

Leave any content surrounded by hashes (#) as is!

For example `Good #topic# night #user_identifier#...` is `Buenos #topic# noches #user_identifier#...` and will turn into `Buenos d-chat noches Lynn.74760...`.

## Extra

There are some helper utilities for translations.

* ChromeExtensionI18nHelper for Sublime Text plug-in: it is designed for Google Chrome extensions, but it is also available WebExtensions-based Firefox addons.
* web-ext-translator: a Java-based editor for translators.
