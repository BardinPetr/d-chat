# Notes for translators

Leave any content surrounded by hashes (#) as is!

For example `Good #topic# night #user_identifier#...` translates so that #topic# and #addr# still exist; they are placeholders and will be replaced afterwards. `Buenos #topic# noches #user_identifier#...` will turn into `Buenos #d-chat noches Lynn.74760...`.

## Extra

There are some helper utilities for translations.

* ChromeExtensionI18nHelper for Sublime Text plug-in: it is designed for Google Chrome extensions, but it is also available WebExtensions-based Firefox addons.
* web-ext-translator: a Java-based editor for translators.

If you want to know changes in the main en locale, you can compare the latest code with any specific version. For example, changes from the version 4.1.0 is: https://gitlab.com/losnappas/d-chat/compare/4.1.0...master
